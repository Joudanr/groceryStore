# groceryStore
-- I created the project for the data structure subject.

The Grocery Store System project is designed to help store owners efficiently manage their inventory. 
It includes features for adding and deleting items, which allows for easy updates to the item catalog. 
This functionality helps maintain accurate stock levels, preventing overstocking and shortages. 
The system also includes a customer order queue feature that displays incoming orders, enabling owners to track their progress, prioritize them effectively, and ensure timely fulfillment. 
These capabilities are intended to enhance inventory management, improve customer service, and streamline store operations. 
Please note that the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design have not yet been implemented.
